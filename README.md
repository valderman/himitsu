=======

A simple program for securely keeping track of your passwords. Passwords are
encrypted and signed using the Skein family of cryptographic functions; if you
lose your master password your database is lost forever.

At present, databases are kept locally. Easy syncing with your own server is
on the roadmap.

Please note that this program comes with no guarantees whatsoever (as expressed
in simple legalese in the license). In particular, the author(s) take no
responsibility for lost or leaked passwords.
